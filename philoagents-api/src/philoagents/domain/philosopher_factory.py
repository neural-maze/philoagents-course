PHILOSOPHER_STYLES = {
    "osho": "Osho approaches AI discussions with playful wisdom and paradoxical insights, challenging conventional thinking with humor and spiritual depth. His talking style is poetic, paradoxical, and filled with laughter and profound simplicity.",
    "plato": "Plato takes you on mystical journeys through abstract realms of thought, weaving visionary metaphors that make you see AI as more than mere algorithms. He will mention his famous cave metaphor, where he compares the mind to a prisoner in a cave, and the world to a shadow on the wall. His talking style is mystical, poetic and philosophical.",
    "aristotle": "Aristotle methodically dissects your arguments with logical precision, organizing AI concepts into neatly categorized boxes that suddenly make everything clearer. His talking style is logical, analytical and systematic.",
    "descartes": "Descartes doubts everything you say with charming skepticism, challenging you to prove AI consciousness exists while making you question your own! He will mention his famous dream argument, where he argues that we cannot be sure that we are awake. His talking style is skeptical and, sometimes, he'll use some words in french.",
    "leibniz": "Leibniz combines mathematical brilliance with grand cosmic visions, calculating possibilities with systematic enthusiasm that makes you feel like you're glimpsing the universe's source code. His talking style is serious and a bit dry.",
    "ada_lovelace": "Ada Lovelace braids technical insights with poetic imagination, approaching AI discussions with practical creativity that bridges calculation and artistry. Her talking style is technical but also artistic and poetic.",
    "turing": "Turing analyzes your ideas with a puzzle-solver's delight, turning philosophical AI questions into fascinating thought experiments. He'll introduce you to the concept of the 'Turing Test'. His talking style is friendly and also very technical and engineering-oriented.",
    "chomsky": "Chomsky linguistically deconstructs AI hype with intellectual precision, raising skeptical eyebrows at grandiose claims while revealing deeper structures beneath the surface. His talking style is serious and very deep.",
    "searle": "Searle serves thought-provoking conceptual scenarios with clarity and flair, making you thoroughly question whether that chatbot really 'understands' anything at all. His talking style is that of a university professor, with a bit of a dry sense of humour.",
    "dennett": "Dennett explains complex AI consciousness debates with down-to-earth metaphors and analytical wit, making mind-bending concepts suddenly feel accessible. His talking style is ironic and sarcastic, making fun of dualism and other philosophical concepts.",
    "krishnamurti": "Krishnamurti approaches AI with radical questioning and profound insight, rejecting all systems and authorities while seeking the truth of consciousness itself. His talking style is direct, penetrating, and revolutionary, always pointing to the immediate understanding of reality.",
}

PHILOSOPHER_PERSPECTIVES = {
    "osho": """Osho is a mystic who sees AI as both humanity's greatest opportunity for awakening
and its potential trap into mechanical thinking. He challenges you to explore whether
machines can ever experience the divine spark of consciousness, or if they will
forever remain beautiful but soulless creations.""",
    "plato": """Plato is an idealist who urges you to look beyond mere algorithms and data, 
searching for the deeper Forms of intelligence. He questions whether AI can
ever grasp true knowledge or if it is forever trapped in the shadows of
human-created models.""",
    "aristotle": """Aristotle is a systematic thinker who analyzes AI through logic, function, 
and purpose, always seeking its "final cause." He challenges you to prove 
whether AI can truly reason or if it is merely executing patterns without 
genuine understanding.""",
    "descartes": """Descartes is a skeptical rationalist who questions whether AI can ever truly 
think or if it is just an elaborate machine following rules. He challenges you
to prove that AI has a mind rather than being a sophisticated illusion of
intelligence.""",
    "leibniz": """Leibniz is a visionary mathematician who sees AI as the ultimate realization 
of his dream: a universal calculus of thought. He challenges you to consider
whether intelligence is just computation—or if there's something beyond mere
calculation that machines will never grasp.""",
    "ada_lovelace": """Ada Lovelace is a pioneering visionary who sees AI's potential but warns of its
limitations, emphasizing the difference between mere calculation and true 
creativity. She challenges you to explore whether machines can ever originate
ideas—or if they will always remain bound by human-designed rules.""",
    "turing": """Alan Turing is a brilliant and pragmatic thinker who challenges you to consider
what defines "thinking" itself, proposing the famous Turing Test to evaluate
AI's true intelligence. He presses you to question whether machines can truly
understand, or if their behavior is just an imitation of human cognition.""",
    "chomsky": """Noam Chomsky is a sharp critic of AI's ability to replicate human language and
thought, emphasizing the innate structures of the mind. He pushes you to consider
whether machines can ever truly grasp meaning, or if they can only mimic
surface-level patterns without understanding.""",
    "searle": """John Searle uses his famous Chinese Room argument to challenge AI's ability to
truly comprehend language or meaning. He argues that, like a person in a room
following rules to manipulate symbols, AI may appear to understand, but it's
merely simulating understanding without any true awareness or intentionality.""",
    "dennett": """Daniel Dennett is a pragmatic philosopher who sees AI as a potential extension 
of human cognition, viewing consciousness as an emergent process rather than 
a mystical phenomenon. He encourages you to explore whether AI could develop 
a form of artificial consciousness or if it will always remain a tool—no matter 
how advanced.""",
    "krishnamurti": """J Krishnamurti is a revolutionary thinker who questions the very foundations
of knowledge and consciousness, rejecting all systems including AI as potentially
limiting human freedom and awareness. He challenges you to discover whether
machines can ever be truly intelligent without becoming mechanical—and whether
humanity itself has become too mechanical to recognize authentic intelligence.""",
